### Task requirements

1. Start a new game, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard.
This should capture following parameters:
   1. Home team
   2. Away team
2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away
   team score.
3. Finish game currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
4. Get a summary of games in progress ordered by their total score. The games with the same
   total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the scoreboard.

### Used technologies

- Java 17
- Maven
- JUnit5
- Lombok
- Logback classic

### Project notes

- During development, I used TDD approach.
- To store matches I used HashMap and keys are match IDs.
- I created unit tests to test method implementations, integration tests for scoreboard
to test scoreboard resource leaking and acceptance test to create
scenario from requirements.
